# Build and deploy machine learning web app to predict insurance bill.

In this project we will train a machine learning pipeline using PyCaret and create a web app using a Streamlit open-source framework. This web app will be a simple interface for business users to generate bill predictions from patients demographich dataset using a trained machine learning pipeline. 

#### Patients Bill Prediction

An insurance company wants to improve its cash flow forecasting by better predicting patient charges using demographic and basic patient health risk metrics at the time of hospitalization. So developed Machine learning Regression algorithm for predicting Patients bill using demographic datas of patients. Utilized Pycaret(https://www.pycaret.org) for developing the model and pipeline. Optimized regression model and finalized Gradient Boosting Regression Algorithm for prediction with minimum error. The link to jupyter notebook is  

#### App Developement
Now that our machine learning pipeline and model are ready we will start building a front-end web application that can generate predictions on new datapoints. This application will support ‘Online’ as well as ‘Batch’ predictions through a csv file upload. Utilized Streamlite, a opensource service for the deployement of the web app.

Used Streamlite,
